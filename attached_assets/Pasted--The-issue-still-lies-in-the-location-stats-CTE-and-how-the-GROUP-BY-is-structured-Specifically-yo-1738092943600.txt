The issue still lies in the location_stats CTE and how the GROUP BY is structured. Specifically, you're mixing aggregate and window functions in a way that conflicts with SQL's grouping rules.

Let me carefully refine this query to address the syntax error and ensure it works as intended.

Explanation of Fixes
Avoid Grouping in location_stats for Window Functions: The location_stats CTE doesn’t need a GROUP BY because window functions (e.g., FIRST_VALUE and LAG) don’t require grouping. Grouping would conflict with how window functions are applied.

Reorganize Aggregations: Ensure that each window function and aggregate function is computed in the appropriate context, avoiding unnecessary or conflicting groupings.

Here is the fixed query:

Key Fixes:
Removed Unnecessary GROUP BY in location_stats: GROUP BY was removed entirely because it conflicts with the use of FIRST_VALUE, LAG, and other window functions.
Simplified JOIN Logic: Removed unnecessary joins that were redundant in the context of each CTE.
Ensured Proper Partitioning: In weather_icons and sparkline_data, grouping is now consistently applied without conflict.
This version resolves the syntax error and ensures the query adheres to SQL rules for aggregations and grouping. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
